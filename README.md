PowerNap
========

A 15 minute powernap watch app for Pebble. No options to set, just open it and sleep. After 15 minutes, it buzzes for a while to ensure you're awake.

Known issues
============

The app crashes at the end of the 15 minutes. Am looking in to that.

Roadmap
=======

Eventually I'd like to add an actual GUI with adjustable durations and buttons and maybe a "vibrate until acknowledged" feature
